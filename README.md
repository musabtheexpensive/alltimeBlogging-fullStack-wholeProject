How does it differ from a website? Why does every business seem to have one? You may even ask yourself, how can I start my own blog?

(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ .. Blogs are a type of regularly updated websites that provide insight into a certain topic. The word blog is a combined version of the words “web” and “log.” At their inception, blogs were simply an online diary where people could keep a log about their daily lives on the web. They have since morphed into an essential forum for individuals and businesses alike to share information and updates. In fact, many people even make money blogging as professional full-time bloggers.

Blogs are a source of knowledge, opinion and concrete advice.
